Following these steps will prepare you to run analog hamiltonian simulations on your local computer.
Instructions must be followed on a Unix/Linux system or using Linux subsystem on Windows. You must have
'git' and 'python' installed before proceeding.
It is recommended to install anaconda python so that the following installation can be kept in a virtual environment.
For example, if you have anaconda installed and working, I recommend creating/activating a new conda environment before proceeding
 via running the terminal command `conda create -n ahs` and then `conda activate ahs`. You will then activate this environment
 whenever you want to run analog hamiltonian simulations. I tested everything with python v1.9.12. If you have issues please try 
 installing this version by running `conda install python==1.9.12` within the ahs environment.

1. `pip install amazon-braket-sdk`
